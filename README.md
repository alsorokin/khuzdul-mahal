#### Simulating a match-3 game

This project is at its inception, so there's not much to talk about yet.

Currently, this is a simulation of a generic match-3 game, with an API which should allow for some machine learning magic to happen in future. I also want to add some computer vision and automation stuff so that when the model is trained, it could see the game field of an actual game and manipulate it.

Don't mind the name. This should mean something like "dwarven maker" in Khuzdul, the dwarven language. Don't ask why.
